# Case

For the case a calculator like box with space for an LCD display has been chosen.
The buttons have been placed on the top.
An USB-A connector is included for power supply and to flash the device.
Instead an independent power 5V power supply can be attached.
Furthermore the USB host connector has been placed in the front to connect an USB joystick.

In the back the cables and the phot sensor can be packed.

In order to fit everything in the USB connector and the power supply connector have been removed from the Arduino.
The USB connector on the USB shield has been left there. In parallel wires have been connected to a connector in the front.

The labelling was done with a SW called FrontDesign. You find it [here](../HW/Panel.pfd).


# Hint

Use a white or gray case instead of a black one.
The labeling will be much easier because you can print black on a transparent foil with a laser printer.
